# Filter-App
A Simple photo filter android app.

*The app-debug file is the output .apk file.

This is the app that I was taught in Harvard's CS50 course. 

How it works : -
   - Allow Permission to access files.
   - Tap on add image button and select an image.
   - When image gets loaded select any filter you like from the options provided.
   - Tap on Save image to save the image in your phone.

Hope you like it!!!

Note: This App uses Glide-transformation for applying varioud filter.
